# Neural Style Transfer

The original code of this exercise was part of the Deep Learning Specialization course by Andrew Ng. After completing the assignment, I reran the code in Colab with my own image. 

I used a photo I took in Roussillon in France as the content image. For the style image, I used Van Gough's Starry Night. 

After about 2500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01, the following output was resulted.
